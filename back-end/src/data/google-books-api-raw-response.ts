				description:
					"My fourth web development book is simply called React.js Book. It will walk you step by step through the process of setting up a development environment and learning Reactive programming from start to finish. React is a library unlike any other I have worked with. Unlike jQuery where you had to learn a number of methods that do very specific things, it's largely inspired by a programming methodology for creating fast web applications.In addition you will be expected to know or at least be briefly familiar with prerequisite knowledge of other web development tools such as Node.js, NPM, Babel, JSX and WebPack. These are not required elements of programming with React, but without them things would be tough.As of 2017, Reactive programming is an alternative way of thinking about web applications. It provides software patterns that make your web app extremely responsive to user input and generally feel faster to the end-user (people who are using your application.) The Virtual DOM alone is enough of a reason to switch to React. Programming with React library, is a lot more than just learning about and using React objects, components, states, props and methods. It requires previous experience with JavaScript and at times assumes knowledge of software principles not inherent to React library itself.This book is not a list of object names, methods and functions with side explanations of what they do. Rather, it deals with the said principles involved in React programming thought up by the creators of React library. Principles that are usually understood by professional web developers and software engineers.For all these reasons stated above, this book will gradually walk you through the process of becoming familiar with React library, starting from basic concepts. Gradually, we will move toward more advanced subjects. So, prepare to be educated",

What You Will Learn Install powerful React.js tools to make development much more efficient Create React elements with properties and children Get started with stateless and stateful React components Use JSX to speed up your React.js development process Add reactivity to your React components with lifecycle methods Integrate your React components with other JavaScript libraries Utilize the Flux application architecture with your React components Test your React components with Jest test framework In Detail Building web applications with maintainable and performant user interfaces is a challenge that many have faced for more than a decade, but no one has risen to this challenge quite like React.js. Today React.js is used by Facebook, Instagram, Khan Academy, and Imperial College London, to name a few. Many new users recognize the benefits of React.js and adopt it in their own projects, forming a fast-growing community. The speed at which React.js has evolved promises a bright future for those who invest in learning it today. React.js Essentials will take you on a fast-paced journey through building your own maintainable React.js application. Begin by exploring how you can create single and multiple user interface elements. Create stateless and stateful components and make them reactive, learn to interact between your components and lifecycle methods and gauge how to effectively integrate your user interface components with other JavaScript libraries. Delve deep into the core elements of the Flux architecture and learn how to manage your application using stores. Finish by going that extra mile with the Jest test framework, running multiple tests on your application and find solutions to scale it further without complexity. Style and approach The book adopts a step-by-step, hands-on approach with ample codes to ensure you learn React.js at a fast pace.",

					"Summary React in Action introduces front-end developers to the React framework and related tools. This clearly written, example-rich book begins by introducing you to React, diving into some of the fundamental ideas in React, and working with components. In the second section, you'll explore the different ways that data works in React as well as learning more about components. You'll also find several useful appendixes covering related topics like React tooling and the React ecosystem. Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications. About the Technology Facebook created React to help deliver amazing user experiences on a website with thousands of components and an incomprehensible amount of traffic. The same powerful tools are available to you too! The key is a clever design for managing state, data flow, and rendering, so your application is easy to think about and runs smoothly. Add an incredibly rich ecosystem of components and libraries, and you've got a recipe for building web apps that will delight both developers and users. About the Book React in Action teaches you to think like a pro about user interfaces and building them with React. This practical book gets you up and running quickly with hands-on examples in every chapter.

					"Get up and running with ReactJS by developing five cutting-edge and responsive projects About This Book Create pragmatic real-world applications while learning React and its modern developer tools Build sustainable user interfaces by transforming data into components of UI Learn how to generate reusable ReactJS components effectively Who This Book Is For If you are a web developer and wish to learn ReactJS from scratch, then this book is tailor-made for you. Good understanding of Javascript, HTML, and CSS is expected. What You Will Learn Create, reuse, and compose React components using JSX Share data between various React components and techniques for data flow within a React app Handle user interactions with the help of event handlers and dynamic components Set up and use various next generation ES2015/ES6 features with React Understand the performance and immutability features of React using React add-ons Learn the techniques of Animation in React Use data stores to store model-related data and information Create a flux-based React application by using Reflux library In Detail ReactJS is an open-source JavaScript library that brings the power of reactive programming to web applications and sites. It aims to address the challenges encountered in developing single-page applications, and is intended to help developers build large, easily scalable and changing web apps. Starting with a project on Open Library API, you will be introduced to React and JSX before moving on to learning about the life cycle of a React component. In the second project, building a multi-step wizard form, you will learn about composite dynamic components and perform DOM actions. You will also learn about building a fast search engine by exploring server-side rendering in the third project on a search engine application. Next, you will build a simple frontpage for an e-commerce app in the fourth project by using data models and React add-ons. In the final project you will develop a complete social media tracker by using the flux way of defining React apps and know about the best practices and use cases with the help of ES6 and redux. By the end of this book, you will not only have a good understanding of ReactJS but will also have built your very own responsive frontend applications from scratch. Style and approach An easy-to-follow program to learn ReactJS with the help of real world projects. Each topic is explained within the context of a project and provides plenty of tips and tricks for using ReactJS.",
